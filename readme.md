# personal md => pdf workflow

Personal convenience script symlinked to bin so I can generate reasonable looking pdfs from a folder of markdown while keeping script files and stylesheets organized.

Why?

- HTML/CSS > LaTeX
- [WeasyPrint](https://weasyprint.org/) + [CSS3 Paged Media standards](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-page-3/) are pretty great
- Even my word processor is Electron, styled with HTML/CSS, so why futz with LaTeX?
